Our security system will include encrypting and and decrypting messages. Encrypting will be obtained by first getting the message that will be encrypted and padding it to 128 bits. Then create a randomly generated AESKey and IV. Use them to create an AES encryptor with in CBC mode. Use the AES encryptor to encrypt the padded message. For integrity, then generate an HMAC key that will be used in SHA256 to to hash the ciphertext and get a tag. We then get the public key of the person that will be receiving the ciphered message. Use the public key to create an RSA encryptor to encrypt the concatenated AES and HMAC keys. To decrypt do the opposite; decrypt the keys using the reciever's private key and then use the HMAC key to create another tag and compare the tags. If the tags are the same the message is authenticated so we use the AES key to decrypt the cipher text and then unpad it. 

Registering yourself as a user will be used authenticate users. For registering a user and saving them into the the database, you get their username and password first. O the server generate an IV and use it to hash the password using PKCS7. This will use the IV ans SHA512 to has the password 10000 times. The username and the hashed password are then stored in the database along with the IV. To login and authenticate the user, you get the username and password again. Check if a user with the same name exists in the database. If they do, get the hashed password and IV. Use the IV to hash the password that was given and check if the hashed passwords matched. If they did, create a JWT that stores the username and signs it using RSA256 and a private key. Our connections with the server must also be secured which is achieved by using SSL.
